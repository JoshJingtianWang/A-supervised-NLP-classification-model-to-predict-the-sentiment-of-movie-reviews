# A supervised NLP classification odel to predict the sentiment of movie reviews
The data is the movie_reviews from the nltk.corpus library.

The data includes a sample of 2,000 reviews, half of them labeled as “positive” and the other half labeled as “negative.” Using NLP functions, review text was converted into numerical representation (i.e. term-by-document matrix) and the resulting table was used to predict the dependent variable (i.e. sentiment label).
